  "startingText": ". The Runic Language\n\nRunic is a bold[markup language] and toolchain for producing high quality general-purpose documents using simple and intuitive text annotations.\n\nRunic is designed to work well in large, complex documents. The language sports a finely-tuned lexer and parser built for speed, fault tolerance and extensibility, accessible through your favourite text editor, the command-line and via WebAssembly.\n\n: Using Runic\n\nRunic can be used in a wide-range of places. Anywhere that you use a traditional word processor, Runic can step in to get the job done, such as:\n\n- Academic writing\n- Documentation\n- Authoring of books\n- Blogs and articles\n- CVs and resumes\n- Note taking\n\nTry typing in the box on the left to edit this text and see the result update in real-time in the pane on the right.\n\n: Why markup?\n\nUsing a markup language to write documents provides you with a wealth of benefits. With markup languages, you use annotations in your text to choose how your document should be displayed. Nothing is hidden behind convoluted menus and distracting user interfaces - with markup, it's just you and your writing, allowing you to focus on what really matters.\n\nDue to the nature of markup being just text, you can write your document in whichever text editor you feel most at home in. Use your favourite colourscheme, font and keymaps to write your documents in a way that suits you. With traditional word processors, you are constrained to write your document in the same visual state that it will eventually be exported in, which may not be a suitable or comfortable appearance for actually writing the document. You may prefer writing in a dark theme to reduce eye strain, or use a particular font to help with dyslexia."
